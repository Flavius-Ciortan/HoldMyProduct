# HoldMyProduct

**HoldMyProduct** is a WordPress plugin designed as an add-on for WooCommerce. It allows customers to **reserve a product for a limited period of time**, holding it for them before purchase. This feature is perfect for stores that want to let shoppers temporarily secure items without immediately completing the checkout process.

## Features

- Seamless integration with WooCommerce
- Reserve a product for a customizable time window
- Prevents other customers from purchasing the reserved item during this period
- Automatic release of reservation after the timer expires
- Simple and intuitive interface for both store owners and customers

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- WooCommerce plugin installed and activated
- PHP 7.4 or higher (PHP 8.x compatible)

## Installation

1. Ensure WooCommerce is installed and activated.
2. Upload the `holdmyproduct` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin via the WordPress "Plugins" menu.
4. Configure reservation time and other settings in the plugin options panel (found under WooCommerce settings).

## Usage

- Customers can reserve available products directly on the product page.
- Reserved products will be held for the specified time limit.
- Once the reservation expires, the product becomes available to other customers.
- Store admins can view and manage reservations from the WooCommerce admin panel.
